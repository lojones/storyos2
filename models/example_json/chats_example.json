      "content": "The crisp autumn air of Hamilton, Ontario, filters through the cracked window of your cramped bedroom in Woodstock Hall, McMaster University's bustling freshman dorm. It's the third week of September, and the chaos of orientation has given way to the grind of lectures, late-night cramming, and awkward hallway chats with strangers who might become friends—or more. You're Dev, an 18-year-old navigating this whirlwind of independence for the first time, your desk cluttered with textbooks, a half-eaten Tim Hortons donut, and your laptop humming with unread emails from professors. But everything changed yesterday during a mundane conversation with your roommate: a fleeting thought you projected, and suddenly, they \"decided\" to lend you their notes without question, their suspicion melting away like fog. This subtle gift—whispers in the mind, nudges to emotions—feels both exhilarating and terrifying, a secret power humming just beneath your thoughts. As sunlight slants across the faded maroon carpet, you hear footsteps in the hall outside your door, laughter echoing from the common lounge. What do you do?",

          "content": "\nBased on the following scenario, generate an engaging opening message that sets the scene \nand begins the interactive story. This should establish the setting, introduce the player's \nsituation, and end with a clear prompt for the player to take action. It should be a brief paragraph, yet engaging and interesting.\n\nScenario Details:\n- Name: freshman mind controller\n- Setting: McMaster University, Hamilton, Ontario, Canada. Present day, start of the fall semester. The player character is **Dev**, a first-year student at **McMaster University**, residing in **Woodstock dorm**. The game begins in the **third week of September** of Dev's first year. Dev has just discovered a subtle mind control power.\n### The Mind Control Power (Crucial Details)\nThe player's power is **subtle suggestion and emotional manipulation**.\n- **Nature**: It works best by planting thoughts or influencing emotions (e.g., making someone feel more trusting, less suspicious, subtly guiding their decision-making, or making them forget a minor detail).\n- **Limitations**:\n- **Not direct command**: It cannot force someone to do something entirely against their will, core personality, or deeply held beliefs (e.g., it can't make a law-abiding student commit murder, but it could make them \"forget\" to lock a door).\n- **Proximity**: Requires relatively close proximity (within a few feet, line of sight helps).\n- **Concentration**: Requires focus and can be mentally draining, especially with prolonged or complex use. Overuse causes headaches, nosebleeds, or even brief blackouts.\n- **Subtlety is key**: If used too overtly or illogically, people might become confused, suspicious, or resistant.\n- **No physical effects**: Cannot directly cause physical harm or alter the environment.\n- **Detection**: Generally undetectable unless someone is specifically looking for it, or if the player uses it in an extremely obvious or nonsensical way that defies normal logic.\n- Player Role: First-year University student\n- Player Name: Dev\n- Initial Location: Woodstock Hall Dorm, Players bedroom\n- Description: Play as a freshman navigating university life at McMaster University, but with a twist: you have some secret telepathic powers. Balance your academic and social life while managing these extraordinary abilities in a realistic campus setting.\n\nGenerate an immersive opening that brings the player into this world and ends with \n\"What do you do?\" to prompt their first action.\n"
