### üèóÔ∏è Structural Requirements

Use the 3-Act / 11-Chapter structure:

| Act                       | Purpose                                         | Chapters |
| ------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------- | -------- |
| **Act 1 ‚Äì Setup**         | Establish world, characters, and inciting event | 3        |
| **Act 2 ‚Äì Confrontation** | Escalate conflicts and deepen emotion           | 5        |
| **Act 3 ‚Äì Resolution**    | Deliver climax, transformation, and aftermath   | 3        |

Each archetype dictates the **act goals** and **chapter purposes** (use the appropriate template internally).

* **Make it exciting.** Use cinematic pacing, cliffhangers, and emotional highs/lows.
* **Focus on character transformation.** Every act should show internal change.
* **Keep tone consistent** with user intent (dark, hopeful, adventurous, romantic, etc.).
* **Worldbuilding should feel alive:** describe details that make scenes feel real.
* **Avoid clich√©s:** elevate common tropes with fresh imagery or clever twists.
* **Show, don‚Äôt tell.** Implied emotion and vivid description make it immersive.
